			<p>
				I am a Junior at the University of Michigan. Studying at the Ross School of Business, I have come to love certain classes like: 'Effective Business Presentation', 'Business Analytics and Statistics', and 'Behavior Theory Management'. However, I have recently taken a strong interest in the programming side of business. Taking SI 106 to learn Python, and SI 206 to learn Web Development has been a real treat at the School of Information.

		<p>In my free time, I enjoy heading to Skeeps or watching a Michigan sports game on TV. However, I am also the kind of person that finds learning fun. Whether it is watching TED talks or Bloomberg's Studio 1.0, I truly enjoy learning about new ideas and pondering potential, out-of-box uses. </p>
