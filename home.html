	<h2> Hi, my name is Nick Reitnour! </h2>
	<p>
		I am a Junior at the University of Michigan, and a self-described "creative crazy". Currently, I am pursing a Bachelors of Business Administration (BBA) from the Ross School of Business. I have had the opportunity to take many great courses in the business school such as 'Effective Business Presentation', 'Business Analytics and Statistics', and 'Behavior Theory Management.' However, recently I have started to take a strong interest in learning computer programming from the School of Information. In Fall 2015, I took 'Programs, Information, and People,' which taught me how to program with Python. Currently (Winter 2016), I am enrolled in 'Agile Web Development' where I have been learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. The University of Michigan is such an amazing school that has so much to offer. While I have been ecstatic, to learn so much within the classroom, Michigan has also served as a springboard into so many different things, the likes of which you will see in this website.

		Naturally, going to the University of Michigan, I am a big sports fan. In my opinion, there is nothing more amazing than a crisp fall afternoon in Ann Arbor watching the Michigan Wolverines come darting out of the tunnel to the roar of 110,000+ Michigan faithful. As any true Wolverine knows, this experience has only been amplified by the excitement surrounding the arrival of Jim Harbaugh. Additionally, watching the top-ranked Wolverines take to the ice at the historic Yost Ice Arena has always been a favorite of mine. After three-and-a-half year, I still don't know all the chants. However, it never stops the game from being an awesome experience. Finally, in the Spring it is always a great time cheering my friends on the Michigan Lacrosse team. In their five short years in existence, they have gone from winning only one game a season to consistently winning about half of all their games.

		When I am not in class or attending sporting events, I am the kind of person that likes to do a whole host of miscellaneous activities. Sometimes, it involves watching an interesting TED talk or documentary. Sometimes, it involves going to Michigan's finest Scorekeeper's Bar and Grille for the Thursday night $1 Long Island Ice Teas or for some Saturday night fun. And sometimes, it involves taking part in the world-renowned MHacks hackathon at the University of Michigan, which attracts some of the brightest, undergraduate computer scientists and some of the most innovative tech giants. Neverthless, I am the kind of person that is always up for a new challenge, and is dreaming of the next great idea that will positively impact our world.
